<h1 align="center" id="title">Karatel's Batch Obfuscator</h1>

<p id="description">This project was made for fun and very quickly. Updates will perhaps be made one day in order to create a true robust obfuscator.</br>note from 10 Feb 2025: i'll update the project and make a TKinter/GUI version, i hope you'll like new version/execution method :)</br></br>Remember: This repo is only to show that it is easy to bypass anti-virus from scantime, the current method is by doing a batch dropper</p>
